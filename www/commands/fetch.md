## The `fetch` Command

### Syntax

```ebnf
fetch <stringLike> [<object literal>] [ as [ a | an ]( json | Object | text | request ) ]
```

### Description

The `fetch` command issues a [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) request to the
given URL. The URL can either be a naked URL or a string literal.

By default the result will be processed as text, but you can have it processed
as JSON, as HTML, or as a raw request object by adding the `as json`, `as html`
or `as request` modifiers.

Additionally, you can use [conversions](/expressions/as) directly on the
response text.

This command saves the result into the `it` variable.

This command triggers the event `hyperscript:beforeFetch`. This event receives the parameters for the command as its `event.detail`. This is useful to globally change the behaviour of fetch, for example to add a custom header to every request.

```javascript
document.body.addEventListener('hyperscript:beforeFetch', (event) => {
    event.detail.headers['X-AuthToken'] = getAuthToken();
});
```

This command is asynchronous.

### Examples

```html
<div
  _="on click fetch /example
                 put it into my.innerHTML"
>
  Get from /example!
</div>

<div
  _='on click fetch /test {method:"POST"} as json
                 put "$it.result" into my.innerHTML'
>
  Post to /test!
</div>

<div
  _="on click fetch `${pageUrl}` as html
    get the textContent of the <h1/> in it
    call alert(result)"
>
  Get the title of the page!
</div>

<div
  _='on click fetch /number {method:"GET"} as Number
                 put "${it + 1}" into my.innerHTML'
>
  Increment!
</div>
```
