hyperscript makes writing event handlers and highly
responsive user interfaces easy with a clear, DOM-oriented syntax and by transparently
 handling asynchronous behavior for you &mdash; easier than callbacks, promises, even async/await.

hyperscript is in active development, working towards 1.0. The syntax and core
feature set are reasonably complete. We're focusing on more test cases and
docs. Please join us at the
<a style="font-weight: bold" href="https://htmx.org/discord">#hyperscript discord channel</a>
&mdash; thank you!

NB: because hyperscript relies on
[promises](https://caniuse.com/?search=Promise) it cannot offer IE11
compatibility
