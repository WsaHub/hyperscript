## Documentation

### Quick Start

Include hyperscript:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/hyperscript.org"></script>
```

Then add some hyperscript to an element:

```html
<div _="on click call alert('You clicked me!')">
  Click Me!
</div>
```

### Introduction

hyperscript is a small, expressive scripting language designed to embed well directly in HTML (thus satisfying the
[Locality of Behaviour Principle](https://htmx.org/locality-of-behaviour/)). It is a companion project of [htmx](https://htmx.org)
and the two integrate automatically when used together.

hyperscript is inspired by the [HyperTalk](https://hypercard.org/HyperTalk%20Reference%202.4.pdf) programming language
and has a distinct english-like syntax, with native event-handling syntax.  hyperscript transpiles to ES5.1 
and thus is compatible with all modern browsers, as well as IE11.

#### Yet Another Language?

I know.

The initial motivation for the language was the [event model](https://htmx.org/reference/#events) in htmx.  I wanted
to have a way to utilize these events naturally and directly within HTML.  Most HTML tags support `on*` attributes
for handling standard DOM events (e.g. `onClick`) but that doesn't work for custom events.  In intercooler, I had
handled this by adding a bunch of custom event attributes, but that always felt hacky and wasn't general enough
to handle custom events triggered by response headers, etc.

Additionally, I wanted to have a way to address some useful features from intercooler.js, but without causing htmx
to lose focus on the core request/response processing infrastructure:

* [`ic-add-class`](http://intercoolerjs.org/attributes/ic-add-class.html) and [`ic-remove-class`](http://intercoolerjs.org/attributes/ic-remove-class.html)
* [`ic-remove-after`](http://intercoolerjs.org/attributes/ic-remove-after.html)
* [`ic-post-errors-to`](http://intercoolerjs.org/attributes/ic-post-errors-to.html)
* [`ic-action`](http://intercoolerjs.org/attributes/ic-action.html) and all the associated attributes

The more I looked at it, the more I thought that there was a need for a small, domain specific language for all this, rather 
than an explosion in attributes and inline javascript, or a hacky custom syntax as with `ic-action`.

#### The Language

So, what does hyperscript look like?  

As mentioned above, hyperscript is designed to embed well directly within HTML:

```html
<button _="on click add .clicked">
  Add The "clicked" Class To Me
</button>
```

The underscore (`_`) attribute is where hyperscript is stored.  You can also use `script` or `data-script` attribute, or 
configure a different attribute if you don't like those.

The script above says

> On the 'click' event for this button, add the 'clicked' class to the button

The syntax reads a lot like the english does.  This is intentional and drawn from HyperTalk (and its successors, such 
as AppleTalk)

You can extend this example to target another element like so:

```html
<div id="a-div">I'm a div</div>
<button _="on click add .clicked to #a-div">
  Add The "clicked" Class To That Div Above Me
</button>
```

Now the `clicked` class will be added to the div with the id `a-div`, rather than to the element the event handler is
on.

You can see in the example above that hyperscript has native syntactic support for CSS class literals as well as well 
as ID references.  This makes it easy to express common DOM manipulations without a lot of unnecessary syntax.

#### The Basics

Now that you've seen a basic introduction, let's look at the broader language.

A `hyperscript` consists of one or more [features](#features).  Currently, the only feature supported right now
is the [`on`](/features/on) feature, which instantiates an event listener on the current DOM element.

A feature then contains a series of [commands](#commands), a term taken from HyperTalk.  A more standard name would
be "statements", but calling them "commands" is fun.  A command typically consists of a starting keyword (which makes
parsing easy!) and then a series of keywords and [expressions](#expressions).

A command list is a series of commands, optionally separated by the `then` keyword:

```html
<div _="on click add .fadeMe then wait 200ms then remove me">
  Fade & Remove Me
</div>
```

The `then` keyword is particularly recommended when commands are on the same line, for clarity.

Some commands, such as the [if](/commands/if) command contain lists of other commands as well.

Expressions are the root syntactic element.  Some should be very familiar to developers:

* Number literals - `1.1`
* String literals = `"hello world"`
* Array literals = `[1, 2, 3]`

While some are a bit more exotic for an imperative programming language:

* ID Ref = `#foo`
* Class Ref = `.tabs`

Below is a reference for the various features, commands and expressions available in hyperscript:

### <a name='features'></a>[Features](#features)

|  name | description | example
|-------|-------------|---------
| [on](/features/on) | Creates an event listener | `on click log "clicked!"`

| [add](/commands/add) | Adds content to a given target | `add .myClass to me`
| [ajax](/commands/ajax) | Send an AJAX request | `ajax GET /demo then put response into my.innerHTML`
| [call/get](/commands/call) | Evaluates an expression (e.g. a Javascript Function) | `call alert('yep, you can call javascript!)` <br/><br/> `get prompt('Enter your name')`
| [if](/commands/if) | A conditional control flow command | `if me.selected then call alert('I\'m selected!')`
| [log](/commands/log) | Logs a given expression to the console, if possible | `log me`
